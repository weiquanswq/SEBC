#Boot camp
This boot camp is very useful for me. I tend to negelect some of configurations and resolve it after the cluster is up. 


#Topic familiarise
I am not very familiar with security topic , especially tls. I made alot of mistakes during the workshop but with guidance from michael and fellow course mates, I pulled it through with a better understanding.

Apart from setting up of cluster, Next will be kerberose.

# Readiness
I believe I can setup a production cluster with 1 more month of practice. 

#What to improve 
Need to have a clearer picture on how TLS works.



#Most importantly

Thanks so much ~!!! 
It won't be that smooth sailing without the help of all the instructors.
